	<h4> Statistics: Bullying Cases Up by 21% In Philippine Schools </h4> <br><br>
	<p align='justify'> <font face='calibri' size='4'> According to the consolidated report of Department of Education (Dep Ed),
								bullying caseson elementary and high school of both private and public schools on 2014 rose by 21% 
								or a total of 6,363 cases, compare with the 5,236 on 2013.  This translates to 31 daily bullying cases
								from a divisor of 201 school days. The statistics was disclosed by Rep. Gerald Anthony Gullas Jr.,
								a member of the House committee on basic education. [ source: Interaksyon ] </font></p><br>
					<center><img src='t.png' width='70%'></center><br><br>
	<p 	align='justify'> <font face='calibri' size='4'>
								In my opinion, it‚Äôs too early to say, the rise of reported bullying cases is a consequence of the 
								reporting requirements of the law.  Bullying cases is rampant, however, it remain under reported 
								prior to the anti-bullying act. This is understandable, since no parents or even school administration
								would like his/her family or school to be famous because of bullying. <br><br>
								
								Schools, however, to mitigate the effects and reduce the incidence of bullying, should comply with
								the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Anti-bullying law of 2013 to address the root causes
								of bullying.  And the important ones, aside from the reporting requirements, are as follows: <br><br>
								
								<b>1.	Schools to have prevention program that is comprehensive, multi-faceted, and shall involve all
								education stakeholders and personnel. This may contain: </b><br><br>

								<b>3.	Students have a duty to intervene to protect the victim, unless the same jeopardizes their safety/security</b> <br><br>

									‚Ä¢	Rep of parents as designated by PTA<br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
									‚Ä¢	Rep of students, except in kinder, as designated by student council-optional for private schools<br><br><br>
								<b>6.	Jurisdiction for complaints of bullying and other acts under the IRR: exclusive: DepEd or private school and not subject to barangay settlement</b> <br><br>
								<b>7.	Procedures must include:</b> <br><br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
									‚Ä¢	Immediate responses-ANYONE who has personal knowledge must immediately call the attention of ANY &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp school personnel<br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
									<b>	School personnel once notified is expected to intervene:</b><br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
									‚Ä¢	Stop the bullying immediately<br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
									‚Ä¢	Remove students from harm and provide medical attention if needed<br>
									&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
									‚Ä¢	Bring the bully to the Guidance Office or designated personnel<br><br><br>
								<b>8.	Anonymous reporting to be entertained</b> <br><br>

	<h4> [OPINION] Bullying and the forgotten virtue of justice </h4> <br><br>
	<p align='justify'> <font face='calibri' size='4'>As individuals and as a nation, I suspect we‚Äôll always be confused and won't achieve the unity and progress we hope
													for unless we understand and apply the proper dollop of justice to balance our proclivity for mercy</font></p><br>
					<center><img src='s.png' width='70%'></center><br><br>
	<p 	align='justify'> <font face='calibri' size='4'> Put most simply, justice is giving people what is due them. It is considered one of the ‚Äúhard‚Äù virtues because it
													involves keeping your compassion and empathy in check to keep right order, as opposed to the countervailing ‚Äúsoft‚Äù 
													virtue of mercy, which is ‚Äì let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äì much easier to practice for most people (except perhaps for those with 
													anger management issues). Anyone who‚Äôs had to discipline a beloved child, or even a pet dog, knows this. <br><br>
													
													Our most crucial organizing institutions and practices necessarily reflect both justice and mercy, though if one steps
													back, it is obvious which one is more important to keeping a society functional. This country couldn‚Äôt exist for a week 
													without the Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Not to put down any of the great work 
													they do, but the Philippines could exist indefinitely without the Department of Social Welfare and Development.<br><br>
													
													I suspect that our strong, almost unidimensional bias for mercy ‚Äì and lack of insistence on justice ‚Äì stems from our 
													Catholic faith. This bears some explanation: On cursory reading, the New Testament surely feels like its emphasis is on
													mercy, even though Jesus Christ talked about hell more than anyone else in the Holy Bible. <br><br>
													
													For reasons unknown, Flipinos usually interpret Jesus' crucifixion as purely an act of mercy. It's obviously not just 
													that: someone had to pay for mankind‚Äôs sins, and God had to send His Son to do pay the ultimate price. Being perfect 
													justice, He couldn‚Äôt simply write off mankind‚Äôs transgressions. Moreover, Christ and His Church both teach one has to 
													accept this gift of redemption in word and deed by following Christ‚Äôs teachings, for it would be unjust to benefit from 
													a gift you don‚Äôt accept. <br><br>
													
													How then are we as a society supposed to balance two contradictory but necessary principles like mercy and justice? The
													plain answer is: as best we can as mere mortals. God can be both infinite mercy and perfect justice, but we can only 
													scratch our heads and plod along, keeping both these virtues in mind. <br><br><br>
													
													<font size='5'><b>Understanding Forms of Forgiveness</b></font><br><br>
													Perhaps our cultural unilateralism towards mercy may be tempered if we understand that there are 3 kinds of forgiveness:<br><br>
													
													<i>Exoneration or absolution.</i> This is what we Filipinos are most familiar with ‚Äì complete forgiveness ‚Äì simply because this
													is what we (wrongly) usually assume is automatically given to us Catholics after the sacrament of confession. What people 
													often forget is that such absolution comes with serious prerequisites of true penitence, admission of guilt and apology,
													and finally, penance. Therefore, the usual notion we hear that we should forgive all as we are forgiven as well by God is 
													not accurate at all. Absent those 3 conditions, even an all-loving God will not give complete absolution to a person because
													He is also all-just, and you should act in the same manner by extension.<br><br>
													
													<i>Forbearance.</i> This applies to a partial apology (made disingenuously, lightly, or with an attempt to share the blame), or when
													an invalid excuse is given or full restitution is not made, but there is reason enough to maintain a relationship with, or a 
													position for the person. The proper approach here would be more akin to ‚Äúforgive but don‚Äôt forget,‚Äù or the Russian adage of 
													‚Äútrust but verify.‚Äù The previous state of affairs need not be restored, but further punishment or restitution is no longer 
													sought. For instance, in many jurisdictions, a released felon who has served time or has been granted clemency is not allowed
													to hold public elected office nor certain sensitive jobs (e.g. stock broker). More mundanely, under this precept, one would be 
													allowed not to invite an offending relative to all your parties, even though you may choose to still keep in touch in other ways. <br><br>
													
													<i>Release.</i> If no sufficient reason exists to maintain the relationship with the people concerned ‚Äì they are unrepentant and have not 
													made any restitution ‚Äì releasing them is the proper course of action, or severing the relationship altogether. Since this is a form 
													of forgiveness, one no longer seeks revenge or harbor ill will for the offending party. The reason is not related to justice, but
													merely practical: harboring a grudge or anger is not healthy for anyone. But it does not preclude application of justice ‚Äì for example,
													one may testify in court about a crime in the name of justice, not revenge. <br><br>
